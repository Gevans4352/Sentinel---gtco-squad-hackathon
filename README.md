### AI-Powered Real-Time Fraud Intelligence System for Squad Payments

**Hackathon:** Squad Hackathon 3.0 — Smart Systems: The Intelligent Economy  
**Team:** NovaCore — Nkenchor Chioma & Femi-Olagundoye Oluwaferanmi  
**Track:** Proof of Life Submission  
**Date:** May 2026

## Overview

Sentinel is a real-time AI fraud detection and response system built on top of Squad's payment infrastructure. It intercepts every transaction via Squad's webhook, runs it through a 3-stage hybrid AI engine (rule-based scoring + Z-score anomaly detection + Isolation Forest ML), and automatically acts on the result — approving, flagging, or blocking and refunding — in under 500ms.

It acts as an intelligent security layer between Squad webhooks and merchant fulfillment systems, with a live dashboard that gives merchants full visibility into every risk decision.

---

## Problem Statement

Digital payments in Nigeria are growing rapidly, but fraud is growing just as fast. Merchants using Squad currently face:

- No real-time fraud scoring at the transaction level
- No automated pre-fulfillment fraud blocking
- Chargebacks detected too late — after money is already lost
- SMEs cannot afford enterprise fraud systems
- No explainability — merchants don't know *why* a transaction was suspicious

Sentinel solves this by introducing **real-time AI-driven fraud prevention directly into Squad merchant workflows**.

---

## Solution

Sentinel introduces a **3-stage hybrid AI engine** that:

1. Receives Squad `charge_successful` webhooks in real time
2. Validates HMAC-SHA512 signature and deduplicates
3. Enriches the transaction with card BIN metadata (bank, type, country)
4. Runs 10 fraud rules (R01–R10) covering velocity, amount anomalies, off-hours activity, foreign cards, and more
5. Applies Z-score statistical anomaly detection against per-customer history
6. Scores using an Isolation Forest ML model trained on behavioral features
7. Produces a 0–100 trust score with explainable reason codes
8. Automatically triggers actions based on tier:

| Score | Tier  | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0–30  | GREEN | Approve transaction |
| 31–70 | AMBER | Flag for manual review |
| 71–100 | RED  | Block + auto-refund via Squad API |

## Fraud Rules (R01–R10)

| Rule | Code | Signal |
|------|------|--------|
| R01 | `AMOUNT_SPIKE` | Amount is 3× above merchant average |
| R02 | `HIGH_VALUE_NEW` | First-time payer with very high amount |
| R03 | `OFF_HOURS` | Transaction placed between 1–4 AM WAT |
| R04 | `HIGH_VELOCITY` | Same email used 3+ times in 5 minutes |
| R05 | `BIN_PATTERN` | Same card BIN linked to 5+ emails in 60 min |
| R06 | `BEHAVIOUR_MISMATCH` | Sudden jump from habitual spend amounts |
| R07 | `FIRST_TIME_PAYER` | No prior transaction history for this email |
| R08 | `ROUND_AMOUNT` | Exact round million in kobo — common fraud fingerprint |
| R09 | `FOREIGN_CARD` | Card BIN identified as non-Nigerian |
| R10 | `UNKNOWN_BIN` / `PREPAID_CARD` | BIN not in database or card is prepaid |

---

## Squad API Integration

| API | Endpoint | Used For |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Webhook | `POST /webhook/squad` | Real-time transaction ingestion |
| Verify Transaction | `GET /transaction/verify/:ref` | Cross-validate AMBER transactions |
| Refund | `POST /transaction/refund` | Auto-refund RED (full) + AMBER (partial) |
| Transaction History | `GET /transaction` | Import last 30 days on first login |
| Disputes | `GET /dispute` | Populate disputes panel |
| Challenge Dispute | `POST /dispute/merchant/challenge` | Submit AI evidence |
| Account Balance | `GET /account/balance` | Verify merchant API key on setup |
| Cancel Token | `PATCH /transaction/cancel/recurring` | Block future charges on fraud cards |

## Machine Learning Approach

### Model: Isolation Forest (Unsupervised)

Sentinel uses Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in transaction behavior without requiring labeled fraud data.

**Feature vector (6 dimensions):**
- `amount` — transaction amount in kobo
- `hour` — hour of day in WAT (West Africa Time)
- `is_first_time` — whether the email has prior history
- `velocity` — number of recent transactions from same email
- `bin_count` — number of distinct emails from same card BIN
- `amount_vs_avg` — ratio of amount to merchant average

**Why Isolation Forest:**
- Fraud patterns evolve constantly — unsupervised learning adapts
- No labeled fraud dataset required
- Works well with behavioral outliers
- Efficient for real-time inference

---

## Demo Mode

Sentinel includes a full demo mode for presentations without a Squad account:

- Realistic simulated transactions using real Nigerian BINs (GTBank, Zenith, UBA, Access, Ecobank)
- Fixed email pools for AMBER/RED so history-dependent rules fire after a few transactions
- Foreign BINs for RED scenarios (JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, NatWest)
- Auto-timer fires a new transaction every 45 seconds (15% RED, 15% AMBER, 70% GREEN)
- Manual RED / AMBER / GREEN trigger buttons in the sidebar

## Impact

Sentinel shifts fraud detection from:

>  After-money-lost detection

to:

> Before-money-leaves prevention

This reduces financial loss, improves merchant trust in digital payments, and brings enterprise-grade fraud intelligence to SMEs who cannot afford traditional fraud systems.
